Code for weighted imaginary coherence computation.

1. Run Main_coherence_parallel.m to compute weighted imaginary coherence for a chosen set of subjects. The code is parallelized.
2. Other scripts are functions called by the above script and subsequent functions.

The following toolbox should be downloaded and included on MATLAB path before running the code.

Wavelet software used is available open source online provided by C. Torrence and G. Compo, and is available at URL: http://atoc.colorado.edu/research/wavelets/.
