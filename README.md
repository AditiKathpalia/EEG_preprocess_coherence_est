# EEG_preprocess_coherence_est
Code for preprocessing EEG data and estimating weighted imaginary coherence between EEG channel pairs

Authors: Aditi Kathpalia and Milan Paluš

This project consists of 2 sets of codes:

1. For EEG preprocessing. Codes in folder 'Preprocessing'.
This set requires the use of EEGLAB software [1].

2. For weighted imaginary coherence computation using wavelets. Codes in folder 'Coherence_computation'.
This set requires the use of wavelet toolbox available at https://atoc.colorado.edu/research/wavelets/ [2]
